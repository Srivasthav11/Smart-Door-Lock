# Smart-Door-Lock
The Smart Door Lock system uses Putty and a GUI for password protection. On each failed attempt, it shows "Invalid Try." After multiple failures, the LED blinks and the LCD displays "Access Denied." With the correct password, the LED lights up and "Access Granted" appears on the LCD.
